-This (read-only) file gives the number of files presently opened.
-It contains three numbers: the number of allocated file handles;
-the number of free file handles; and the maximum number of file handles.
-The kernel allocates file handles dynamically, but it
-doesn't free them again.
-If the number of allocated files is close to the
-maximum, you should consider increasing the maximum.
-When the number of free file handles is
-large, you've encountered a peak in your usage of file
-handles and you probably don't need to increase the maximum.
+Historically, the kernel was able to allocate file handles
+dynamically, but not to free them again. The three values in
+file-nr denote the number of allocated file handles, the number
+of allocated but unused file handles, and the maximum number of
+file handles. Linux 2.6 always reports 0 as the number of free
+file handles -- this is not an error, it just means that the
+number of allocated file handles exactly matches the number of
+used file handles.
