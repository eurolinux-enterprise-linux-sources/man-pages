+.IR _res.options .
+By default, glibc performs IPv4 and IPv6 lookups in parallel since
+version 2.9.
+Some appliance DNS servers
+cannot handle these queries properly and make the requests time out.
+This option disables the behavior and makes glibc perform the IPv6
+and IPv4 requests sequentially (at the cost of some slowdown of the
+resolving process).
+.TP
+.BR single-request-reopen " (since glibc 2.9)"
+The resolver uses the same socket for the A and AAAA requests.  Some hardware
+mistakenly only sends back one reply.  When that happens the client sytem will
+sit and wait for the second reply.  Turning this option on changes this behavior
+so that if two requests from the same port are not handled correctly it will
+close the  socket and open a new one before sending the second request.
